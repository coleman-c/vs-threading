## Severity descriptions

Severity  | IDs     | Analyzer catches...
--------- | ------- | -------------------
Critical  | 1-99    | Code issues that often result in deadlocks
Advisory  | 100-199 | Code that may perform differently than intended or lead to occasional deadlocks
Guideline | 200-299 | Code that deviates from best practices and may limit the benefits of other analyzers
